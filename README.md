# Disease-Risk-Prediction
"A Machine Learning project that predicts disease risk using KNN and Naive Bayes algorithms. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations. Built using Python and scikit-learn to analyze real-world health data for early risk detection."

## 📌 Features
- KNN classification with K optimization  
- Naive Bayes classification  
- Data preprocessing & scaling  
- Accuracy calculation  
- ROC curve visualization  
- Accuracy vs K value graph

  ## 📊 Results
- Best K value gives *high accuracy*  
- ROC curve plotted for evaluation  
- Notebook contains *all outputs*

  ## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
2. Upload the .ipynb file  
3. Install required libraries:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
